Investment and Bond Calculator

This Python script provides two financial calculators: an Investment Calculator and a Bond Calculator. Users can choose between these options to calculate either the expected return on an investment or the monthly repayment amount for a home loan.

# **Usage**
To run the script, execute it in a Python environment and follow the on-screen instructions. The user will be prompted to choose between an investment and a bond calculator by entering either 'investment' or 'bond' as per the provided menu.

# **Investment Calculator**

If the user selects 'investment,' they will be prompted to enter the following details:

Deposit Amount: The initial amount of money invested.
Interest Rate: The annual interest rate as a percentage.
Investment Period: The number of years the money will be invested.
Interest Type: Choose between 'Simple' and 'Compound' interest.
The script will then calculate and display the expected return based on the user's input.

# **Bond Calculator**
If the user selects 'bond,' they will be prompted to enter the following details:

Current House Value: The current value of the house.
Interest Rate: The annual interest rate as a percentage.
Repayment Period: The number of months over which the bond will be repaid.
The script will calculate and display the monthly repayment amount based on the user's input.

# **Note**
For the Investment Calculator, ensure that the interest type is entered as either 'Simple' or 'Compound.' Any other input will result in an error message.
The script is case-insensitive, so users can input 'investment' or 'Investment' interchangeably.
Feel free to use and modify the script according to your needs. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvement, please let us know.
